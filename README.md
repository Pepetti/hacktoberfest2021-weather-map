Globe dots should be colored according to regional temperatures.

Front end stack: WebGL/three.js for globe, React for other stuff..

Back end: NodeJS, weather API (maybe https://www.weatherapi.com/ ?)

Database: MongoDB, if we store just the latest weather data and update every few hours, maybe a simple key value store.
