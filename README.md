Globe dots should be colored according to regional temperatures.


Front end stack: WebGL for globe, React for other stuff..

Back end: NodeJS, weather API (maybe https://www.weatherapi.com/ ?), maybe some geography api

Database: TBD, if we store just the latest weather data and update every few hours, maybe a simple key value store.
